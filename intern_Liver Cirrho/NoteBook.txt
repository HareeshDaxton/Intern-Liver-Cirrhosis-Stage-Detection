ðŸ“Œ Column: Status
C = 'Censored' â€” the patient was still alive at the end of the study.
CL = 'Censored due to Liver Transplantation' â€” patient got a new liver, not dead.
D = 'Death' â€” the patient died during the study

ðŸ“Œ Column: Drug
It shows what treatment each patient received during the study.
D-penicillamine = 'The patient received the actual medication.' -> 'D-penicillamine' is a real drug used for liver diseases.
Placebo	 = The patient received a 'fake treatment' (dummy pill) â€” no active drug. -> Placebo is used to test whether the drug is truly effective, or if the patient improves simply because they think they're being treated.

ðŸ“Œ Column: Ascites:
This indicates whether the patient had ascites at the time of registration.
What is Ascites?
   -> Ascites is the abnormal buildup of fluid in the abdomen, often caused by severe liver disease like cirrhosis.
   -> It's a sign of liver failure or disease severity.
Yes â†’ Patient had ascites (fluid present)
No â†’ Patient did not have ascites

ðŸ“Œ Column: Hepatomegaly:
This tells whether the patient had hepatomegaly â€” a clinical condition observed during examination.
What is Hepatomegaly?
    -> Hepato = 'liver'
    -> Megaly = 'enlargement'
So, Hepatomegaly means 'enlarged liver', which is a common indicator of liver disease (including cirrhosis or liver inflammation).

ðŸ“Œ Column: Spiders:
 What are Spider Angiomas ("Spiders")?
    ->They are small, spider-like blood vessels visible just beneath the skin.
    ->'Commonly seen in patients' with liver cirrhosis or liver failure.
    ->Considered a sign of 'advanced liver disease'

ðŸ“Œ Column: Edema:
Indicates the presence and severity of edema (fluid swelling) and whether the patient is under diuretic treatment.
What is Edema?
    -> Edema is swelling caused by fluid retention, often in the legs or abdomen.
    -> In liver disease, it results from low albumin or portal hypertension.
    -> Severity and treatment status matter in prognosis.
 N = No edema, and not taking diuretics
 S = Edema present, but responds well to diuretics (treatment working)
 Y = Edema present, and not controlled by diuretics (severe case)

 ðŸ“Œ Column: Bilirubin:
 It represents the serum bilirubin level in the blood, measured in mg/dL (milligrams per deciliter).
 What is Bilirubin?
    -> Bilirubin is a yellow substance produced when your body breaks down old red blood cells
    ->Normally, the liver filters it out of your blood and sends it into your bile (to be excreted in stool).
    -> If your liver is damaged, bilirubin builds up in the blood, causing yellowing of the skin and eyes â€” acondition called jaundice.
0.3 â€“ 1.2 = 'Normal range'
1.3 â€“ 3.0 = 'Mildly elevated'
> 3.0 = 'High â€” indicates liver dysfunction'
"In liver disease (like cirrhosis), high bilirubin means poor liver function."

ðŸ“Œ Column: Cholesterol:
<200 = Desirable / Normal
200 - 239 = Borderline high
> 240 = 	High â€” medically concerning

ðŸ“Œ Column: Albumin:
This indicates the serum albumin concentration, measured in grams per deciliter (g/dL).
What is Albumin?
    -> Albumin is the main protein made by the liver.
    -> It helps maintain oncotic pressure (i.e., keeps fluid in your blood vessels).
    -> It also transports hormones, vitamins, and drugs throughout the body.
3.5 - 5.0 = Normal
< 3.5 = Low â†’ Sign of liver dysfunction, malnutrition, or inflammation
>5.0 = Rare, may indicate dehydration or lab error

ðŸ“Œ Column: Copper:
Represents urinary copper excretion, measured in micrograms per day (Âµg/day).
< 50 Âµg/day = Normal
50â€“200 Âµg/day = Possible mild increase
> 300 Âµg/day = Abnormal â€“ could indicate Wilsonâ€™s disease or advanced liver disease

ðŸ“Œ Column: Alk_Phos:
Represents Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) level in U/L (units per liter) â€” a key liver function marker.

What is Alkaline Phosphatase?
    -> ALP is an enzyme found mainly in the liver, bile ducts, and bones.
    -> It plays a role in breaking down proteins.
    -> The liver releases ALP into the bloodstream during liver damage, bile duct obstruction, or bone disorders.

~44â€“147 U/L (normal range) = Normal in most labs
> 147 U/L= Could indicate:

ðŸ“Œ Column: SGOT:
SGOT: Serum Glutamic-Oxaloacetic Transaminase
Also known as AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase).

What it is
SGOT is an enzyme found in:

Liver

Heart

Muscles

Kidneys

Brain

It helps with amino acid metabolism. When cells in these organs are damaged, SGOT leaks into the bloodstream.

Common Clinical Ranges:
>40 = Normal
40 -100 = Mild elevation (may suggest fatty liver, early cirrhosis)
100-300 = Moderate elevation (active hepatitis, bile duct issues)
>300 = Severe elevation (acute liver injury, drug toxicity)
>1000 = Very high (acute viral hepatitis, ischemic liver injury, toxin exposure)


ðŸ“Œ Column: Triglycerides:
ðŸ§ª In Medical Terms:
Triglycerides are measured in mg/dL (milligrams per deciliter).
High levels can be a sign of:
    Liver problems (like cirrhosis)
    Poor diet (too much sugar or fat)
    Uncontrolled diabetes
    Alcohol abuse
    Metabolic syndrome

Why it Matters:
In liver disease (like cirrhosis), triglyceride levels can be abnormally high due to:
    Disruption in liverâ€™s ability to process fats.
    Hormonal and metabolic imbalances.

< 150 = Normal
150 â€“ 199 = Borderline High
200 â€“ 499 = High
â‰¥ 500 = Very High (risk of pancreatitis)

ðŸ“Œ Column: Platelets
Platelets are tiny cells in your blood that help stop bleeding. When you get a cut, they clump together and form a plug to seal the wound.
Low = < 150
Normal = 150 â€“ 400
High = > 400

ðŸ“Œ Column:Prothrombin:
Prothrombin Time measures how long blood takes to clot. It's a key marker of liver function, especially important in liver diseases like cirrhosis because the liver produces clotting factors.
 11 s = Possibly faster clotting (rare or lab variation)
11â€“13.5 s = Normal
> 13.5 s = Prolonged clotting time â€“ often due to liver dysfunction or vitamin K deficiency
